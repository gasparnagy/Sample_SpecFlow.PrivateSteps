# SpecFlow.PrivateSteps Sample

Demonstrating how to limit the visibility of SpecFlow step definitions when reused in other projects.

The step definition methods that are declared as `internal` can only be used in the feature files of the same assembly.

An alternative approach is to use a custom attribute (e.g. `[PrivateSteps]`) as shown in branch [using_attribute](https://github.com/gasparnagy/Sample_SpecFlow.PrivateSteps/tree/using_attribute).
